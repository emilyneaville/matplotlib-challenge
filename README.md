### Trends, Observations, and Analysis of the mouse metadata and study results
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.


- Looking at the high level analysis provided by the bar and pie charts, it is clear that we have sufficient data for the drug of interest, Capomulin, with 230 out of 284 mice being given the treatment (the most mice out of the dataset). Additionally, we do have an almost even split of males (51%) and females (49%) in the dataset in an attempt to reduce any bias in our dataset.

- Analyzing the final tumor volume in mice per treatment proved to be highly informative. Filtering the data to analyze only the final timepoint of mice throughout treatment shows only the final results of each treatment, allowing  researchers to better determine the end-effectiveness of each drug. Analyzing the boxplots, it is clear that Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective treatments out of the 4 drugs of interest, with Capomulin proving to be the most consistently effective treatment according to this study.

- The linear regression model provides insight on determining how much of an impact weight (independent variables) has on the tumor volume (dependent variable). A moderate positive correlation of 0.71 can be observed between Weight (g) and Average Tumor Volume (mm3) in mice on the Capomulin regimen.
